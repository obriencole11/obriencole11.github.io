<h3 id="recursion-is-a-sci-fi-horror-short-film-built-in-the-unity-game-engine">Recursion is a sci-fi horror short film built in the Unity game engine.</h3>
<!--more-->

<p>The film follows a lone spaceman who, after a sudden crash landing, arrives in a dark dimension of endless barren grassland. With resources scarce, the spaceman ventures forth, slowly discovering that he is no longer alone in this world.</p>

<p>This project was built as my senior degree project at Massart. I worked on the majority of the assets including the programming, modelling, animation, and rigging. I worked with a sound designer for the score and an SFX artist for the foley. Additionally I worked with a UI artist to built the space helmet HUD. It took about 9 months to complete, and the film was screened at the animation departmental show at the Museum of Fine Arts in the spring of 2016.</p>

<h2 id="modelling">Modelling</h2>

<p>The low-poly modelling for the film was all done in Maya. A hi-poly version was created as well and baked on as a normal map.<img src="/uploads/2017/04/27/SpacemanModel.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="texturing">Texturing</h2>

<p>The texturing was done mostly in Quixel, using four maps, an Albedo, Metallic, Ambient Occlusion and Normal Map.<img src="/uploads/2017/04/27/SpacemanTexture.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="rigging">Rigging</h2>

<p>A custom rig was built for the character in maya, featuring fully IK/FK arms and legs, an IK head and a spline IK spine.<img src="/uploads/2017/04/27/SpineRig.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="animation">Animation</h2>

<p>The custom rig was used for both first person and third person animation. The animating was baked and then imported into unity.<img src="/uploads/2017/04/27/FPSAnimation.gif" alt="" />

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>

<p>The film included several particle effects built using the Unity Shuriken particle editor:</p>

<blockquote>The fire was created with a hand painted image sequence&nbsp;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fire effect was later modified for the crashing ship</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-demo">The Demo</h2>

<p>In addition to the film, a playable demo was also created. It uses the same assets but allows the player to explore the world of the film as a procedurally generated landscape.</p>
