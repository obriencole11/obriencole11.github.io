### Assets for a shader-animation filled music video
<!--more-->

Milwaukee is a long-term project I have been working on with a fellow traditional animator [John F. Quirk](https://www.johnfquirk.com/). The project will be a music video for local artist [CYBERBULLY](https://cyberbullyallcaps.bandcamp.com/album/aby). Each of our sequences will be very different, my part however is built entirely in **Unreal Engine**. 

So far, assets for the first scene have been finished, a bright and dreamlike anenome field.

## Design

![Enviroment Beauty Shot]()

The first half of the video is designed to be peaceful and idillic. A dreamlike space in which the main character blissfully explores. The world was built to resemble the real world, but definetly feel surreal.

As a result for this first scene I decided to replicate a wide open field where all vegetation is made of tube-like anenomes:

## Shaders

From a creative side I knew I wanted the world to feel alive, so idle vertex animation made perfect sense. From a technical side, I am a much better programmer than 3D artist, so procedural shader art allowed me to fill a full space with very few base assets. As a result, nearly every asset in the scene contains a procedural element and some sort of shader-based animation.
