As a generalist, I come from a background in 2D and 3D animation as well as a strong foundation in graphic design and programming. Aesthetically, I am drawn to vivid atmospheric and immersive experiences, and strive to create projects that explore new visual territory. On the development side, I enjoy challenging myself to create flexible and efficient animation workflows.


I studied animation at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where I helped lead the [Massart Game Design Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Massart.GDC/). While there I also worked at the game development company, [Harmonix](http://www.harmonixmusic.com/), working as an Animator and Artist for Rock Band 4. Beyond that, I primarily work on my own independent games as well as assist with the animation team for the [Skywind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PewuaPKnhnc) project.
