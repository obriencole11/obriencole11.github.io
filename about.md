I'm a Technical Animator with a focus on animation pipeline and rigging tools. I find it incredibly satisfying to find clean and efficient solutions to complex problems. Besides animation support I often work on custom shaders, modeling tools and game programming.

I studied animation at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where I helped lead the [MassArt Game Design Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Massart.GDC/). Since graduating Iâ€™ve worked as a contractor for AAA game projects. Most recently I supported the animation team at [Avalanche Studios](https://avalanchestudios.com/) for the release of Just Cause 4. Previously I have also worked with [Harmonix](http://www.harmonixmusic.com/) for Rock Band 4. 

Beyond that, I primarily work on my own game projects as well as lead the animation department for [Skywind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PewuaPKnhnc).
