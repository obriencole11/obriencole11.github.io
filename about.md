I come into the world of technical art with a foundation in traditional animation and game programming. With these powers combined, I am a technical artist with a focus on animation pipeline and rigging tools. I'm always looking for an interesting problem to solve however, and my work often extends into the realm of shaders, animation, and game programming.

I studied animation at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where I helped lead the [Massart Game Design Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Massart.GDC/). Since graduating, I worked at the game development company, [Harmonix](http://www.harmonixmusic.com/), working as an Animator and Artist for Rock Band 4. Beyond that, I primarily work on my own projects as well as lead the animation team for the [Skywind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PewuaPKnhnc) project.
