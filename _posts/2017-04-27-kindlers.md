### Kindlers is a single-player, puzzle game prototype
<!--more-->

For the past two years I've gotten the chance to work as an Associate Animator and Artist at [Harmonix Music Systems](http://www.harmonixmusic.com/), creators of the Rock Band Franchise. During the development of Rock Band 4, and later the Rock Band Rivals expansion, I was brought on to do the camera, lighting, and lipsync editing for songs. In total I edited over 60 songs featured in the game. Above is an example of a recent DLC song I worked on.

### Cinematography

In addition to editing the camera timing, I also had the chance to create some of the camera angles themselves. Below are a selection of angles I did for the "Arena" venue:

### The Green Room
During the development of the online update for Rock Band, I had a chance to work with the team working on the online lobby screen. I composed the angles for the character portraits, as well as created the moving cameras with state-based programming.

Additionally I also assembled the greenroom environment. I composed the set dressings as well as the lighting. For memory reasons I wasn't originally able to use volumetric lighting in the scene, however I was able to fake it with a shader on a plane for the final scene.

### Screenshots

At the end of Rock Band 4's development I assisted the publishing team in taking promotional screenshots. Here are a selection that are used in promotional material as well as most of the reviews for the game.
