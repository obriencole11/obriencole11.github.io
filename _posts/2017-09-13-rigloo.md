### Rigloo is a component-based rigging solution for Maya
<!--more-->

Rigloo was built with the following goals in mind:

* Allow for **fast** rig prototyping and iteration
* Be **flexible** and support a diverse selection of characters
* Make rigging **accessible** without sacrifising flexibility
* Be **adaptive** and allow for working off of existing animation data

Rigloo is component based. Rigs are constructed with common rig parts that can be customized to fit each character. This design choice was essential to support a variety of body types, as the rig makes very few assumptions on the construction of the users character. Other tools like HIK and Motionbuilders control rig make strict assumptions on character construction and would not work for the project in mind.

Rigloo is code driven. Rigs are built and attached dynamically, meaning it can fit to any skeleton shape. Additionally this was essential to allow for baking the rig to existing animation data. This means the tool can be used for motion capture cleanup or even animation created with other rigs.

Rigloo is open source under the MIT licence, the latest version can be download (here)[]

## Philosophy
While there are plenty of existing solutions for simplifying rig construction, most will include restrictive assumptions about character design. As a rigger, I also desired something that I would be able to use to speed up my own iteration time.

With the goal in mind of maintaining the key creative decisions, I knew I needed a solution of control curves. With a tool built with the concept of supporting a large variety of character types, the user would

## Interface

## Background

Originally built with intention to be used with the (Skywind Project)[] 

Functionally the tool is inspired by Blizzard's code based rigging for Overwatch, as seen in their GDC 2017 talk "The Animation Pipeline of Overwatch". Visually the tool is reminiscent of Unity's component editor, an engine I have much experience with.


## Installation

Currently Rigloo only supports a manual installation. To do so, first create a folder titled 'Rigloo' in: `C:\Users\*User*\Documents\maya\*version*\scripts`

Then download the latest release of the project and extract the contents into that folder.

Then Maya's script editor(make sure its a python editor), add the following text and run it:
```
from rigloo import rigloo_main; rigloo_main.load()
```
The main window should then appear. You can then use this code to create your own shelf button. A custom icon for adding to a shelf is available in `icon/icon-logoShelf.svg`
